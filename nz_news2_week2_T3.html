                        Such public claims by top officials are rare and are likely to intensify concerns over the nature of Iran's nuclear programme.
                        It has advanced its nuclear activities since a deal limiting them faltered.
                        The 2015 agreement began to unravel when the US pulled out and reinstated crippling economic sanctions.<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62372366"> link to story </a></p>
